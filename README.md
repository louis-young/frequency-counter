React application for calculating the density of keywords within content.

## Description

This is an application which calculates the densities of keywords within content, and provides a table detailing the occurrences of each keyword and the density percentage.

## Motivation

I built this application to benefit some peers at work who wanted a clean and concise way to calculate these metrics for writing content for website SEO.
